# SUPERSTORE SALE ANALYSIS

### Project Overview 
Superstore is a fictional retail company based in the United States. They specialize in selling furniture, office supplies, and technology products. Suppose I am a Business Analytics for this superstore. My role is to identity weaknesses and oportunities within their business, and my target is to help them improve their business growth and profitability.

### Business Questions
- What are the KPIs?  
- Which month generates the highest sell? 
- Which product category is the most profitable? 
- Which states and cities account for the highest sell?
- What is the most preferred shipping mode among customers? 
- Which customer segement brings to the most profit? 
- How has the company's performance trend over the year?

### Data Set
The data set includes various superstore's information from 2019 to 2022, including order specific, customer-related, and product-related data. For those who interested in viewing or downloading the dataset, it is included in my this repository.

### KPI
- Over the past 4 years, superstore generated $2.30M revenues but only reached $286.40K profit, which means that the **profit accounts for 12.45% of the total revenue**. The company's average discount stood at 16%, suggesting that the discounting strategy might have influenced the profit margin.
- From 2016 to 2019, the company sold 38,000 product items in total. The dashboard also shows that the superstore's **revenue increased gradually** during the given period.

### Sales Trending  
- During the given period, sales trends showed consistent growth with seasonal fluctuations. Overall, **consumers accounted for the highest sales**. Sales typically **rose from Q1, peaked around mid-year (Q3), and declined towards year-end (Q4)**. In 2016, consumer sales started at 25K in Q1, peaked at 100K in Q4. Corporate and Home Offices are also followed similar seasonal patterns, with Corporate sales peaking at 50K and Home Office 30K in 2016. As a result, focus on running more promotions from Q3 can help to boost the storeâ€™s sales.
- **Orders by Ship Mode**: Most customers go for Standard Class shipping mode, which means that they prioritize cost-savings over fast delivery.
- **Order by Customer**: The consumer segment is the largest customer base. Therefore, superstore should increase the marketing campaign to boost the sales for consumer segment during the peaked period to maximize the sales and profits. The Corporate and Home Office Segment with smaller customers, presents the growth opportunities.

### Profit Trending
- From 2016 to 2019, the profit increased gradually every year, reached nearly $100k in 2019 
- Overall, Technology category  dominated the SuperStore's profit, which accounted for 50.79% of total profit. This suggest that consumer-oriented tech products might be the most profitable items. In contrast, Furniture is the least profitable items across all product categories, indicating potential for cost optimization or pricing adjustments.
